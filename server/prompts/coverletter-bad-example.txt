To whom it may concern,

As a current student in the coop program at UofG, I am eager to improve my skills and
make connections in my field. I have a lot to offer and hope your company could use someone
like me!

I am in my second year of the Computing program and have completed courses such as
CIS*1300, CIS*1910 and CIS*2500 so I have gained a lot of valuable knowledge and
skills. I have worked part time throughout high school and university and have have
learned a great deal about team work, multitasking, time management, customer service,
and organizational skills. I have also been a part of the varsity volleyball team which has
also developed my team work skills. When I took CIS*1910, I gained many skills that
could be useful to your kind of business! Things like logics, functions and relations.
Furthermore, we conducted a logic analysis and I received a good mark. This project
required that I take a leadership role and work as part of a team.

Iâ€™m really interested in learning more about the field and expanding on my skills. I want to stay
in Guelph and I think your company would be a great fit for me! I hope you will agree that I
have a lot to offer you. Please call me anytime day or night with any questions or to book me for
an interview.

Thanks,
